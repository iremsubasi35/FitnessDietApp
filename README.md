# FitnessDietApp

The onboarding and mealplanner parts of the design in the link were my responsibility.
This project was my first SwiftUI project outside of my simple SwiftUI experiments.
This project was made for the purpose of learning SwiftUI with a 2.5-week study. The UI takes precedence.

Meal program fixed code was written due to the upcoming delivery time.
It should be renewed in the long run. The project was created with fake data.
Again, in the long run, mock data should be configured with json.


The project was opened with UIKit considering the router operations. 
With SwiftUI the routingManager is coded.
Normally, navigationview should not be used for this reason.
It was intended to try navigationview in SwiftUI. It should be corrected.
